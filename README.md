# ESPN-Scraper

This Web Scraper is a Python Selenium application that scraps
information from the ESPN website. The user can scrape statistics 
involving the best performing players of a specific team, or
stats from an individual player. 

## Architecture
This ESPN Web Scraper is run using a Flask application, allowing the user to scrape data
from the ESPN website through POST requests from and to the html content.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Python 3 is installed
* Selenium WebDriver and Options are imported
* Import all libraries from requirements.txt
* Make sure you have the correct Chromedriver installed

### Steps to run in PyCharm
1. Check the project prerequisites
2. Run server.py.

[//]: # (3. Run create_db.py. This clears any pre-existing products, and creates a new table.)


## Development Expansion
The scraper can be expanded to provide more functionality for the user, such as parsing
through the HTML in order to retrieve news articles from the website. The scraper could also
implement a SQL Database that can allow users to save information about their favorite teams.
